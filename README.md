# venture_funding_with_deep_learning

## background

The purpose of this repo is to create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by a company.  The business team has provided a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from the company over the years. The CSV file contains a variety of information about each business, including whether or not it ultimately became successful. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business.

To predict whether the company funding applicants will be successful, create a binary classification model using a deep neural network.  This notebook  consists of three technical deliverables. 
* Preprocess data for a neural network model.
* Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.
* Optimize the model.
